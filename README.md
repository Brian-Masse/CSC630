# CSC630
My work over the Phillips Andover course Computer science 630, Data visualization 

All the work can be found in this repo, under either the ```Group Work``` or ```Independent Work``` directory. Each project will have a readme detailing my process, intention, and reflection for any given set of work. I have linked data all the data I used, and occasionaly link to outside repos within individual projects. 

# ENJOY :)
